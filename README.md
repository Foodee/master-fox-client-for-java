# master-fox-client-for-java
Java JSON:API client for interfacing with MasterFox

## CRNK

The client is built on top of the https://github.com/crnk-project/crnk-framework library. Which handles all of the
heavy lifting for the serialization, request making, etc.

The main units are Resources, which are the Data Transfer Objects that map
to Foodee's API. And Repositories, implement the basic CRUD operations overtop
of REST.

## Exercising

Since this is currently a work in progress, you can exercise the library by running the Exercise class.
